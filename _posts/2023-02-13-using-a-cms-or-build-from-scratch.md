## Using a CMS
The benefits that come included with building from a CMS is that a lot of the legwork is done and rarely need to write code. However the amount that the platforms take up on a given machine varies depending on the platform. WordPress takes up the most resources compared to the other two, Drupal and Joomla. 

There are other CMS platforms out there that I have yet to implement and might be a good choice in comparison to the utilization of Joomla and Drupal. I will be doing more research into the decision as time passes on.

The constraints that come with a CMS is learning how to actually develop for the platform to increase the performance and optimize the code itself. Which will take time and dedication as I am slowly catching up with developing on the web. 

## Build From Scratch

Building from scratch requires me to take a considerable amount of time determining the development process in which to build the site from. Rarely is a site built from scratch, rather a template is utilized and the site is built from there. I need to do more practice with the frameworks that I am learning to utilize and surely I will be able to build sites from scratch a whole lot easier than without.

There is only room for improvement and I will start by implementing the LAMP stack for starters. 

### Developing

Learning to utilize Node.js as that is the backend framework that I learning how to implement. For the sake of time though I will be utilizing CMS Platforms such as Joomla, Drupal, and WordPress to get a site up and running. Though as I go through a variety of examples and tutorials. I need to get into the habit of utilizing these examples and tutorials to implement them in the overall build process of the websites I am needing to build. 

I think its time that I learned how to utilize Docker and Kubernates in order to utilize the server properly.

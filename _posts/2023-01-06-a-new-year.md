## Understanding the Importance of A Plan

As I learn, I am coming to a clearer understanding that I overlooked that I have to learn how to take this project and make it simpler for me actually plan out in accordance how I am going to continue to support the site after it is up.

Utilizing what I have, I am learning that the importance of CI/CD is no longer a concept that I can ignore when the entire site is dependent upon a PaaS (Platform as a Service). Which is why I have been finding it difficult to understand the significance of utiliizing Firebase. 

Keeping up with the blogs and development of this site and other sites has become somewhat difficult as I am having to comprehend alot of new ideas and concepts that I never understood or realized this entire time. I am learning though that this year, I will utilize all the languages and frameworks that I need in order to build and develop this site and the next. 

Coming to better understanding of all the technologies that I am implementing and actually being able to learn and build software and websites that will last and stand the test of time.
